          <p>
            Chicken is one of the most popular meals because it is simple, flexible, and tasty.
            You can grill it, bake it, fry it, or cook it in a curry. It also works well with
            rice, pasta, salads, and vegetables.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our kitchen, we focus on clean flavors and balanced seasoning. We use fresh
            ingredients and keep the recipe easy to understand. If you like mild food, you
            can choose lighter spices. If you like strong flavor, you can add extra heat and
            sauce.
          </p>
          <p>
            This section is intentionally very tall so you must scroll to reach the bottom.
            Scrolling helps show that the navbar is not fixed and will scroll away with the
            page. Keep scrolling to see the end of the content.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also care about texture. Some people like chicken crispy on the outside and
            juicy inside. Others prefer it soft and slow-cooked. Both styles can be great
            when the cooking time and temperature are correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many meals start with basic steps: seasoning, heating the pan or oven, and letting
            the food rest after cooking. Resting helps keep the chicken juicy. Small steps
            like this can make a big difference.
          </p>

            Below are quick menu notes:
            grilled chicken with herbs, chicken with garlic sauce, and chicken with mixed
            vegetables. These are simple options that work for most people.
          </p>

          <p id="beef">
            <strong>Beef:</strong> Beef is rich and filling. It can be cooked as steak, stew,
            or stir-fry. The key is choosing the right cut and not overcooking it.
          </p>
          <p id="sushi">
            <strong>Sushi:</strong> Sushi is light and fresh. It is usually served with rice,
            seaweed, and different fillings. It is popular because it tastes clean and is easy
            to eat.
